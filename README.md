Hardware Implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography using reversible logic gates


For hardware implementation of ECC protocols, scalar multiplication is used for a 
public key generation at the sender and receiver end. The performance of the ECC 
protocol greatly depends on the efficient implementation of the scalar multiplication 
operation. In the literature, many authors have proposed different techniques for 
optimizing scalar multiplication operation and optimization can be achieved at a 
different level of computation. 
The project is aimed at designing a reversible Montgomery multiplier used for Elliptic 
Curve Cryptography. The multiplier is divided into five main parts, the right most top 
processing element, the top processing elements, the right border processing elements, 
the left border processing elements and the main processing elements.
